- 👋 Hi, I’m @AraTheRabbit
- 👀 I’m interested in generally learning about Coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (with difficulty finding a space that is not locked behind 500€ paywalls)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every basic aspect
- 📫 You can reach me when the stars are alligned and you speak my name infront of a mirror at 3pm. I want to learn more before getting actually involved in the community and wasting anyones time before I cant even tell the difference between a library and a IDE.
